This is a simple web page that runs a script that creates three racers - a rabbit, a turtle, and a snake - each of which is named by the user and each of which races the number of "laps" designated by the user. The page updates with the name of the winner and the number of laps utimately run by each racer.

This is based upon the JavaScript code presented in class on September 10, with the following additions:

- A third animal, a snake, is added;
- User is prompted for the names of each animal and for the number of laps to race;
- Race code is placed into a "do/while" loop; and
- Script is linked to an HTML page with content updated to show the stats for each racer.
